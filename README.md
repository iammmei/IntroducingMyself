# IntroducingMyself

#### Safae Khanchouf, a Web Developer in the making 


*Just a girl with multiple passions, trying to figure out life and traveling whenever I have the time (and budget).*



### TOP 3 SKILLS

1. **KARAOKE**
 Nobody can't stop me from having a full performance once i arrive at the  karaoke, it's all or nothing.

 2. **EXTREME LUCKY UNLUCKINESS** 
   Bad luck is my friend but i embraced it because it's (almost) always a blessing in disguise.

3. **KOREAN STREET FOOD and FRIED CHICKEN**
 I really wanted to try korean chicken and street food  during the covid but every restaurant i ordered to wasn't meeting my expectations so i improved  my recipes for months and now i have the best recipe.

### What i love the most

- *The sea* : Nothing makes me more happy than being around the sea , it relaxes me physically, mentally and purifyes my soul. Even better when it's blue, clear and accompanied by the sun.
- *Myself* : I am my own bff and the best company i can ever have.
-  *Music* : I love music, i listen to all kind of musics (literally) , from the 30's (or even before)  to now and in  any languages.

- Become the best and richest web developer ever.

### What i value the most to work as a team

*Alone you go faster together we go further*

Everyones is unique, with different skills and interests and when people work together and put their uniqueness together , the result can only be mesmerising 
We learn a lot thanks to others or even helping those with more difficulties isn't that amazing?
Your communications skills can only be improved while working with others.
